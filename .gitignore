### **Step 2: Initialize the Git Repository**

Now, we'll turn your project folder into a Git repository and save your work as the first "commit."

* **Action:** Run these commands one by one from your **root project directory**.

    1.  **Initialize the repository:**
        ```bash
        git init
        ```
    2.  **Add all files to staging** (Git will automatically ignore the files listed in `.gitignore`):
        ```bash
        git add .
        ```
    3.  **Create your first commit** (a snapshot of your code):
        ```bash
        git commit -m "feat: Initial commit of full-stack React and Python AI chatbot"
        ```

### **Step 3: Create a New Repository on GitHub**

1.  Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) in your web browser.
2.  **Repository name:** Give your project a name (e.g., `ai-medical-chatbot-react`).
3.  **Description:** Add a short, professional description.
4.  **Public/Private:** Select **Public**. This is essential for a portfolio project.
5.  **IMPORTANT:** **Do not** check any of the boxes to "Add a README file," "Add .gitignore," or "Choose a license." We have already created these files locally.
6.  Click the **"Create repository"** button.



### **Step 4: Connect Your Local Code to GitHub and Push**

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with some commands under the heading "...or push an existing repository from the command line." We will use those.

* **Action:** Copy the two lines from that page and paste them into your terminal. They will look like this (but with your username and repository name):

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/ai-medical-chatbot-react.git
    git push -u origin main
